1. in folder 'drop', the code is used to 
    * simulate capillary pinchoff of viscous droplet immersed in another viscous fluid
    * use adaptive regridding to approach self-similar singularities before pinching (only for moderate viscosity ratio)
2. in folder 'caff', the code is used to simulate conducting core annular flow in Stokes flow
